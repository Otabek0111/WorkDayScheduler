## Getting Started

Before you start, clone the starter code repository and create your own repository with the starter code. Do not fork the starter code repository!

### Clone the Starter Code

Clone the starter code repository using the following command:

```bash 
git clone git@github.com:Otabek0111/WorkDayScheduler.git
```
Configure Your Repository
Set up your repository with the following:

Clone your newly created repository to your local machine.
Copy the starter code files into your repository.
Commit the initial code.
Push the code to your remote repository.

## User Story
As an employee with a busy schedule, I want to add important events to a daily planner so that I can manage my time effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria
When I open the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
As I scroll down, I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours (9 am to 5 pm).
Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past (gray), present (red), or future (green).
I can click into a time block to enter an event.
When I click the save button for a time block, the text for that event is saved in local storage.
When I refresh the page, the saved events persist.

## Usage
To use the Work Day Scheduler:

Open the index.html file in a web browser.

The current day will be displayed at the top of the calendar.

Scroll down to view time blocks for standard business hours.

Each time block will be color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past (gray), present (red), or future (green).

Click into a time block to enter an event.

Click the save button for a time block to save the event in local storage.

Refresh the page, and the saved events will persist.
